## Battery graphs
Program uses iPhone/iPad self-generated reports to graph how battery stats of the device change trough time.

The different fields to consider are specified in the config file ([template](template.conf)), along with the location of the directory in which log-aggregated* files are on filesystem.

The program assumes that config file path is `~/.config/ios-battery-graph.conf`
