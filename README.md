# ios-scripts
Utilities for iPhone. I use Scriptable (available on App Store) to run these.

### battery.js
It is possible to add fields simply by putting the identifier in the dictionary at the top and parsing the information to put in the dictionary at the bottom. 

### contentToClipboard.js
Content of a file to the clipboard, I believe there is a way to do the same in ios but I'm not aware of it.

### getFilePath.js
Self-explanatory.
